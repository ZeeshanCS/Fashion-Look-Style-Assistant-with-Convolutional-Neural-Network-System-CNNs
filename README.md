# Virtual-Style-Assistant-With-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-System-CNNs

## What This Machine Learning Application Does?
Well, The main motive of this machine learning model/application is to target the modern global fashion industry. In this case study we are going to make a "Virtual Style Assistant" that looks customer Instagram and Facebook images and classify that what fashion category they are wearing either bag, dresses, pants etc. The "Virtual Assistant" can help the retailer to detect and forecast fashion trends and launch target marketing campaigns.

## Description
The global fashion industry is valued at 3-trillion dollars and accounts for the 2% of world DGP. The fashion industry is going to their dramatic transformation by adopting new Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning techniques. 

In this case study we look at the hypothetical situation, we assume that a fashion retailer hire you to build "Virtual Style Assistant" that looks customer Instagram and Facebook images and classify what fashion category they are wearing either bag, dresses, pants etc. The "Virtual Assistant" can help the retailer to detect and forecast fashion trends and launch target marketing campaigns.

In this case study we use fashion mnist datasets to build a machine learning model/application that looks at the images and can tell us exactly what category in this image is it like a short, bag, coat etc. 

Once we have trained deep learning neural network to classify images as human being for-instance a customer love to wear dresses and what category, That means we can do targeting marketing to that specific customer. A prime example what we are going to building "Amazon Look Style Assistance". 

## A Brief Summary Statistics about the datasets

The Fashion training set consists of 70,000 images divided into 60,000 training and 10,000 testing samples. Dataset sample consists of 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The 10 classes are as follows: 0 => T-shirt/top 1 => Trouser 2 => Pullover 3 => Dress 4 => Coat 5 => Sandal 6 => Shirt 7 => Sneaker 8 => Bag 9 => Ankle boot Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255.
